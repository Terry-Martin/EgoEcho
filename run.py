This quiz is not meant to diagnose psychopathy or tell you definitively whether or not youâ€™re a psychopath. But it will give you a pretty good idea, based upon the research. For each item, indicate how much you agree or disagree with the statement. Take your time and answer truthfully for the most accurate results.")
